## How It Works

### 1. Document Upload
- Users can upload PDF files via the upload button or drag-and-drop
- Files are processed using PDF.js to extract text content
- Document metadata (name, size, pages) is stored and displayed

### 2. Text Processing
- PDF text is extracted page by page for accurate content retrieval
- Content is indexed for efficient searching
- Documents are stored locally for persistence

### 3. Question Processing
- User questions are analyzed to determine query type (definition, comparison, summary, etc.)
- Relevant content is searched across all uploaded documents
- Responses are generated with proper citations and context

### 4. Response Generation
- Intelligent response formatting based on query type
- Citation system links responses back to source documents
- Support for various query types: definitions, comparisons, summaries, methodologies
